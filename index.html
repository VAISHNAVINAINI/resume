    <P> <b>A unique web attack detection method for IOT that uses ensemble categorization</b><br>In today's digital
        landscape, the security of online accounts is paramount, and traditional text-based
        passwords often fall short in providing robust protection against attacks like phishing, dictionary attacks, and
        brute force attempts. A Web-Based Graphical Password Authentication System offers a modern solution by
        replacing alphanumeric passwords with image-based or pattern-based authentication methods. This approach
        enhances security by leveraging the visual memory of users, making passwords harder to guess or crack. The
        system allows users to set up passwords by selecting a sequence of images or drawing a pattern on a grid,
        which they must reproduce during login to gain access. Key features of this system include an intuitive user
        interface for easy password creation and authentication, security measures like encryption and image-based
        CAPTCHAs, and a responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices, including desktops,
        tablets, and smartphones</P>
